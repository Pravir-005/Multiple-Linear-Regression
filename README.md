# 📊 Multiple Linear Regression Implementation

A clean and professional implementation of **Multiple Linear Regression** using Python and Scikit-Learn.  
This project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow including preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Multiple Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to model the relationship between one dependent variable and multiple independent variables.

This project covers:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Train-test split
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Model training using LinearRegression
- Performance evaluation
- Prediction on new input data
- Proper prevention of data leakage

## 🧠 Mathematical Foundation

The Multiple Linear Regression model follows the equation:

Y = β₀ + β₁X₁ + β₂X₂ + ... + βₙXₙ

Where:

- Y → Dependent variable  
- X₁, X₂ ... Xₙ → Independent variables  
- β₀ → Intercept  
- β₁...βₙ → Coefficients  

The model minimizes the cost function using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).
